# fusen 0.5.1

## New features

### Inflate all active flat file

- `inflate_all()` uses the configuration file to inflate all your flat files at once. `document` and `check` options are thus only run once for all flat files. (#204, @ymansiaux)
- This requires to run `inflate()` at least once for each flat file.
- This also requires to register all other files, that were present in the package before this version of 'fusen' with `register_all_to_config()`

### List all files created with an `inflate()` in a config file with parameters

- `inflate()` creates a configuration file "dev/config_fusen.yaml" to register all files created while inflating the corresponding flat file, along with inflate parameters (#198, @ymansiaux)

## Breaking changes

- Arguments `rmd` and `name` in function `inflate()` now lead to errors (Deprecated since v0.3.0).
- `add_dev_history()` was deprecated since v0.3.0 in favor of `add_flat_template()`. Now `add_dev_history()` only adds a "dev_history.Rmd" file in the "dev/" directory.
- `add_flat_template(template = "minimal")` no longer exists to avoid confusion between minimal package or minimal flat file. Indeed, now there are `add_flat_template(template = "minimal_package")` (also `add_minimal_package()`) or `add_flat_template(template = "minimal_flat")` (also `add_minimal_flat()`). The latter doing exactly the same as `add_additional()` (#187)
- `create_fusen()` still uses `minimal` as `minimal_package`

## Bug fixes

- Fix using line break after function name in flat files (#142, @FlorenceMounier)
- If project directory is renamed by "my.package (Copy)", `inflate()` still works, even if this name is not a proper package name. What is important is that DESCRIPTION Package name is correct.

## Major changes

- `create_fusen()` and the RStudio gui interface now accept `flat_file` parameter to name the first flat file as well as the first function (when using 'minimal' template).
- The tips and tricks vignette shortly presents how to combine {fusen} and {golem} (#187)
- Incorrect function names issued from addins or `add_flat_template()` are cleaned before being included in the flat file to follow underscore rule.

## Minor changes

- Update CONTRIBUTING to speak about flat file in {fusen} itself
- replace the maintainer's name from `fill_description()` in examples, templates and tests (#155, @FlorenceMounier)
- `create_fusen()` vaccinates created git project (#171)
- Examples under function roxygen documentation are cleaned from extra spaces after empty `#'` to avoid git diff against code linters / stylers.



# fusen 0.5.0

## New features

### Publish your package website on GitHub

- Publish your {fusen} project on a GitHub website with one command: `init_share_on_github()`

### List all files created with an `inflate()` in a config file

- `inflate()` creates a "dev/config_fusen.yaml" file to register all files created while inflating the corresponding flat file (First steps in #24)
- Migrate from a non-fusen package or a previous version of 'fusen' with `register_all_to_config()`
- Create or update the config file from a data.frame with `df_to_config()` to list legitimate scripts (even if not associated with a flat file)

### Others

- Allow multiple examples for the same function (#149)

## Bug fixes

- Fix for when using word "`function(`" in documentation (#174, @FlorenceMounier)

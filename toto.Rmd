# Setup

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Content

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, 
PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well 
as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
knitr::knit_patterns$get()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code 
that generated the plot.

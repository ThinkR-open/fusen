# Parse and split a Rmd / Qmd file, and transform as tibble

This is the core of {fusen}. Where everything starts.  
{fusen} reads your flat file to detect what is a yaml header, 
what is a code chunk and its options, what is a text part.  
Function `get_rmd_parts()` returns a tibble with all these parts.

You're not supposed to use this function directly when working with {fusen}.
However, since {parsermd} is not maintained anymore, you may be interested in
having access to these core functions.


```{r examples}
file <- system.file("tests-templates/dev-template-parsing.Rmd",
  package = "fusen"
)
get_rmd_parts(file)
```

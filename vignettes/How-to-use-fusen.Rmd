# All steps to create a package with {fusen} from one Rmd file

- Create a new directory / new project with
  - RStudio template: File > New Project > New directory > Package using {fusen} 
  - Choose the template `teaching` to start  
  - *Or command line: `create_fusen("path/to/new/project", template = "teaching")`*
- Open the "dev/flat_teaching" Rmd to start setting up the package
- Run the content of the first `development` chunk with `library(testthat)` inside
- Modify and run the content of the chunk named `description` asking to describe your package and license it
  + *For the first time, you can let the code as is, this is already the content for a working package*
- Follow the `"dev/flat_teaching.Rmd"` template to write your documentation and build your functions and test your examples.  
  - Chunk named `function` gets the code of a function
  - Chunk named `example` gets the code for examples of using the function. This will be used for function `@examples` and will be kept for the vignette
  - Chunk named `tests` gets the code for unit testing
  - Chunk named `development` gets the code for development purposes, usually only used once like {usethis} functions
- Run the `dev-inflate` chunk to inflate the flat template and transform it as an inflated package with functions, unit tests and the current Rmd template transformed as a vignette. And check.
- Build your {pkgdown} site to verify everything is at the right place


> Create multiple `"flat_xxx.Rmd"` files with `fusen::add_flat_template(template = "add")` if needed

## Fill your package Description

Fonction `fill_description()` requires the description of your package: What does it do? Who are the developers?  
This will fill the DESCRIPTION file in the proper way. 

```{r example-description, eval=FALSE}
fill_description(
  pkg = dummypackage,
  fields = list(
    Title = "Build A Package From Rmarkdown file",
    Description = paste("Use Rmarkdown First method to build your package.", 
                        "Start your package with documentation.", 
                        "Everything can be set from a Rmarkdown file in your project."),
    `Authors@R` = c(
      person("Sebastien", "Rochette", email = "sebastien@thinkr.fr", 
             role = c("aut", "cre"), comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0002-1565-9313")),
      person(given = "ThinkR", role = "cph")
    )
  )
)
```

## Inflate your package from the flat Rmd template

You're one inflate from flat paper to box.
Build your package from the flat Rmd template using the `inflate()` command below.

After that, you can:

- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
- Build your documentation using `usethis::use_pkgdown()` then `pkgdown::build()` for vignette and examples checks

```{r example-inflate, eval=FALSE}
fusen::inflate(
  flat_file = "dev/flat_teaching.Rmd", 
  vignette_name = "Exploration of my Data",
  open_vignette = TRUE,
  document = TRUE,
  check = TRUE
)
```

# Create a new package from command line directly, using a pre-defined template

- Build a package from Rmd template in a temporary directory
  + _This is for testing purposes_

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create a new project
dummypackage <- tempfile(pattern = "dummy")

# {fusen} steps
dev_file <- create_fusen(dummypackage, template = "teaching", open = FALSE)
# Description
fusen::fill_description(pkg = dummypackage, fields = list(Title = "Dummy Package"))

# From inside the package
usethis::with_project(dummypackage, {
  # Define License with use_*_license()
  usethis::use_mit_license("Sébastien Rochette")
  
  # You may need to execute inflate() in the console directly
  fusen::inflate(pkg = dummypackage, 
                 flat_file = dev_file,
                 vignette_name = "Get started")
})

# Explore directory of the package
browseURL(dummypackage)

# Delete dummy package
unlink(dummypackage, recursive = TRUE)
```

# Add a new "flat_template.Rmd" template in "dev/" directory

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
# Add an additional dev template
add_flat_template(template = "add", pkg = dummypackage)
```

# There can be development actions

These are only included in the flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.

Name the following chunk with `{r development-something, eval=FALSE}`

````
```{r development-inflate, eval=FALSE}`r ''`
# Run but keep eval=FALSE to avoid infinite loop

usethis::use_mit_license("Sébastien Rochette")

# Execute in the console directly

fusen::inflate(flat_file = "dev/dev_history.Rmd")
```
````

# Limitations

- One title / one chunk is for one function
- `examples` and `tests` chunks need to be placed after the associated `function` chunk
- You can add sub-functions in the `function` chunk to store them in the same R file, but they won't have `@examples`. Only the first function of the chunk will be able to get examples.
- As for any Rmarkdown file, chunk names need to be unique. Thus, you better use `examples-myfunction`, `examples-myotherfunction`, ...
- _Do not forget to regularly clear your Workspace to avoid functions hidden by global environment_

\arguments{
\item{pkg}{Path to the package from which to add file to configuration file}

\item{clean}{Logical. Delete list associated to a specific flat file before updating the whole list. Default is set to TRUE during \code{inflate()} of a specific flat file, as the list should only contain files created during the inflate. This could be set to FALSE with a direct use of \code{df_to_config()} too.}

Path to configuration file

\details{
\code{init_share_on_github()} runs multiple steps to be able to share a proper package on GitHub:
\itemize{
\item Start versionning with git if not already
\item Connect to your GitHub account
\item Create a minimal DESCRIPTION file if missing
\itemize{
\item You will have to update its content with your information after deployment
}
\item Add NEWS file to present modifications of your releases
\item Add README.Rmd and knit it to README.md to quickly present the aim and the use of your package
\item Init continuous integration (CI)
\itemize{
\item Check the package on Linux, Windows and MacOS
\item Calculate code coverage. Note that you may need to connect to \url{https://about.codecov.io/} to see the results of the code coverage.
}
\item Init continuous deployment (CD) of the {pkgdown} website documentation
\item Commit and push to GitHub
\item List remaining manual steps to make the website public
